The vbnbsvr sample and vbnbclient sample demonstrate session-based 
communications using NetBios calls. 

You need to run the vbnbsvr first, and click listen. The vbnbsvr 
program will block until the client connects and sends a message 
to it. Then you can start the vbnbclient, and click connect. You 
will see the message exchanges between vbnbsvr and vbnbclient.
